# youtube_automated_scraoingTitle_usingSelenium


Hello, I have created an automated youtube comments scraping platform using selenium, where we have to input a title of your search. And that title will be sent to the youtube.com in the search box, and the top viewed videos based on that Title will be displayed. 

Here I have used Iphone 14 title. 

Further we can also scrape comments of any particualar video based on top views. 

And the data can be used as Sentiment Analysis.
